**CodingCodingCoding**

* Make the links in newly blended node and correct some attribute value.
* Make the simple, newly blended node and put in AtomSpace.
* Check for made blended node and trying to test with several case.

### Pause

* Search for good algorithms to use in each step.
* Design about public API of my project.
  * I think I need to start creating mindagent as soon as possible, instead of 
 various considering about architecture.

## Result
### Done
*  Read 'Pattern Matching' wiki page again.
  * Done.
  * But, I feel understanding full of them will be done when I use that func 
 actually in my project...
* Consider using of python or guile binding in my project.
  * Can't use C++ for my project?
  * Change coding language to python with agents.
  * And trying to start studying guile... It seems familiar with haskell?
* Set python develop environment
  * Done.
  * PyCharm, path, python shell, python agent, etc.
  * Currently, python binding of MindAgent has a bug(https://github.com/opencog/opencog/issues/1614).
  * I've been fighting for this bug almost 2~3 day...
* Try to use pattern matcher samples in python.
  * Done.
  * Recently, (cog-bind blahblah) method was deleted(not sure?) in opencog project,
 so I must use a method - bindlink(atomspace, BindLink handle).
