# Progress summary of 150524-150530
* Beautiful version is available in my wiki
 (http://wiki.dong-min.kim/GSoC_2015_-_Conceptual_Blending)

## Now
### In Progress
* Try to apply STI in my test cases. (Currently test cases use 'BlendTarget' 
 which is only useful in development stage)
  * Continue to next period
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when 
 select node
    * Try to apply Attention Allocation agents
  * Make the waiting queue of ConceptNode
  * Continue to next period
* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare
  * Implement skipping blend and run the next cycle
  * Implement selecting ConceptNode which has best value (proper value)
  * Continue to next period
  
### To do
**Think**
* (empty)

**Study**
* Try to use Unified Rule Engine, PLN in python.
  * Continue to next period
  
**CodingCodingCoding**
* Check the conflict links in each node and remove.
  * Implement removing conflict links
  * Continue to next period
* Detect and improve conflict links in newly blended node
  * Select one by random in 2^k possible things
  * Continue to next period

### Pause
* Search for good algorithms to use in each step.
* Design about public API of my project.
  * I think I need to start creating mindagent as soon as possible, instead of 
 various considering about architecture.
* Implement correct truthvalue of link method selector by passing instance 
 which is subclass of abstract class.
* Make API document.

## Result
### Done
* Implement blender selector by passing instance which is subclass of abstract class.
  * Implement blender selector.
  * Implement test case selector.
* Check for made blended node and trying to test with several case.
  * Done. (Paul & Sally example, Debate with Kant example)
  * However, it doesn't make any sense at current time.
* Fix the atomspace issues in python binding.
  * Occurred by wrong AtomSpace definition in cython binding.
  * See my PR(https://github.com/opencog/opencog/pull/1632)
  * See my PR(https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/pull/63)
* Make a MindAgent works both in cogserver, shell.
  * Can be executed both in cogserver, linux shell without change code.
  * Implement config management system.
  * Make custom log wrapper for debugging.
  * Split some of debug codes to new file.

### Fail & Deadline Missed
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when 
 select node
    * Try to apply Attention Allocation agents
  * Make the waiting queue of ConceptNode
