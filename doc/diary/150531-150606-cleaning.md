# Progress summary of 150531-150606
* Beautiful version is available in my wiki
 (http://wiki.dong-min.kim/GSoC_2015_-_Conceptual_Blending)

## Now
### In Progress
* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare
  * Implement selecting ConceptNode which has best value (proper value)
* Check the conflict links in each node and remove.
  * Implement removing conflict links

### To do
**Think**

* Use python or change to C++?
* How to make blending agent to really useful to OpenCog?

**Study**

* Read thesis written by Goguen and another thesis written by Markus, et al.

**CodingCodingCoding**

* Detect and improve conflict links in newly blended node
  * Select one by random in 2^k possible things
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when 
   select link

### Pause
* Search for good algorithms to use in each step.
* Design about public API of my project, and make its document.
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Make the waiting queue of ConceptNode
  * Currently queue is not need for blending, because now agent make only one 
   new blended node in each step.
  * It will be useful when optimizing blending agent speed by save candidate 
   cache.
* Try to use Unified Rule Engine, PLN in python.
* Change config system to use cogserver's config system.

## Result
### Done
* Try to connect python debugger to cogserver.
  * Done.
  * Python's GIL(GlobalInterpreterLock) policy has little bug in Python 2.x, so
 debugging with PyCharm libraries should be use with some hack codes..
* Try to apply STI in my test cases.
  * Done.
  * 'BlendTarget', which is only useful in development stage, still can be used 
  in test cases by changing option in config file.
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Implement checking for some values in AttentionValue
* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare
  * Implement skipping blend and run the next cycle
    * Done by making interface. Currently it checks only number of atoms.
* Implement correct truthvalue of link method selector by passing instance 
 which is subclass of abstract class.
  * Done by making interface.
* Try to use Unified Rule Engine, PLN in python.
  * Worth the effort, now I can use theirs if I want.
  * However, I have no idea WHERE to apply theirs.
* Optimize implemented code and make simple documentation.
  * Almost all of codes has been refactored for prepare next phase.

### Fail & Deadline Missed
* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare
  * Implement selecting ConceptNode which has best value (proper value)
  * Failed to finish implementing in May 23, 2015.
  * It will be continued to next period.
* Check the conflict links in each node and remove.
  * Implement removing conflict links
  * Failed to finish implementing in May 30, 2015.
  * It will be continued to next period.
* Detect and improve conflict links in newly blended node.
  * Select one by random in 2^k possible things
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when 
   select link
  * Failed to finish implementing in May 30, 2015.
  * It will be continued to next period.
* Optimize implemented code and make simple documentation.
  * Making documentation was impossible due to lack of time.
  
### Cancel
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when 
   select node
    * Checking HebbianLink in selecting node stage is wrong, checking 
     HebbianLink is needed in select link stage.
  * Try to apply Attention Allocation agents
    * There is no agent like this. Allocation of attention must be managed in 
     each agents, and python agent doesn't have this feature now.
