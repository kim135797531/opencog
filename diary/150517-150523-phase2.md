# Progress summary of 150517-150523
* Beautiful version is available in my wiki (http://wiki.dong-min.kim/GSoC_2015_-_Conceptual_Blending)

## Now
### In Progress
* Implement blender selector by passing instance which is subclass of abstract class.
  * Continue to next period
* Check for made blended node and trying to test with several case.
  * Continue to next period
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Implement checking for some values in HebbianLink and SimilarityLink when
 select node
  * Make the waiting queue of ConceptNode
  * Continue to next period  
  
### To do
**Think**

**Study**

* (empty)

**CodingCodingCoding**

* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare
  * Implement skipping blend and run the next cycle
  * Implement selecting ConceptNode which has best value (proper value)
  * Continue to next period  

### Pause
* Search for good algorithms to use in each step.
* Design about public API of my project.
  * I think I need to start creating mindagent as soon as possible, instead of 
 various considering about architecture.
* Implement correct truthvalue of link method selector by passing instance 
 which is subclass of abstract class.
* Make API document.

## Result
### Done
* Select nodes to blending.
  * Select by random
* Decide whether or not to execute blending and prepare.
  * Try blending immediately
* Make the simple, newly blended node and put in AtomSpace.
* Make "agent-step" command simulating.
* Make the links in newly blended node and correct some attribute value.
* Refactor (1. copy link) (2. correct truth value of links) algorithm.
* Find the method to get my link's truthvalue (link.tv is not match with my 
 input).
  * It was bug. See my PR(https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/pull/53)

### Fail & Deadline Missed
